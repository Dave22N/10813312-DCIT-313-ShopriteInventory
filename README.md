This project is an Inventory Management Application for shoprite, made with C# in Visual Studio.
For this project I created 9 screens.
Firstly, a home page where the user can choose to login as an admin, or an attendant.
Then, I created 2 login screens, one for admin logins and the other for attendants.
I created a sales screen, where the attendant can perform sales transactions.
I created an Add User Screen, where the Admin can add and remove a user.
I created an Add Unit Screen, wher the Admin can add and remove units.
I created an Add Dealer Screen, where the admin can add, remove and update dealer information.
I created an Add Product Screen, where the admin can add Products for sale
Finally, I created a Purchase Product Screen where the Admin can buy products from dealers in shoprite's stock.

I also created a datbases with 8 tables to store required information:
Registration table: To store attendant and admin information.
Product_Name table: To store product information.
Stock table: To store products in stock.
purchase_master table: To store purchase information.
order_item table: To store information about products sold.
order_user table: To store information about customer who made sale.
